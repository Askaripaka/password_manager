This is a barebones implementation of a password manager in python.
It is one of my first dev projects

It consists of three files:
  1) main.py file --> this file combines the functionality of the two other files for ease of use
  2) insert.py file --> this file is responsible for creating the SQLITE  database (passwords.py) in the working directory and creating a table 'passwords' which contains three fields:
     - application of type TEXT
     - username of type TEXT
     - passwords of type TEXT
  3) display.py --> this file is responsible for displaying the passwords in the database in the case the user may need to retrieve
